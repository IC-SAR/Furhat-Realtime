- Opportunities for internships, capstone projects, and industry certifications

Paid “real work for real pay” component:
- The Innovation Center emphasizes paid work experiences where students design/engineer technology solutions for industry/community partners.
- The Innovation Center “Our Story” page notes that the IC pays over 100 student designers for after-school work, and offers multiple industry-level professional certifications.

====================================================================
3) FACILITY (SIZE, SPACES, FEATURES)
====================================================================
Current facility size (as publicly described by SVVSD):
- A “state-of-the-art” 50,000 sq. ft. facility (SVVSD program page)
- The SVVSD news “grand opening” story (Sept 2018) also describes a 50,000 sq. ft. facility at 33 Quail Road.

Examples of spaces/features listed by SVVSD:
- Community makerspace
- Apple Tech Lab
- Flexible lab and collaboration spaces
- Incubator and Enterprise Zone
- Studio and Pitch Room
- Drone and Aerospace Lab
- Biomedical Science lab
- Robotics Lab with an underwater tank
- Prototype spaces and classrooms (plus “more”)

====================================================================
4) HISTORY & EXPANSION
====================================================================
Grand opening / new facility:
- SVVSD published a “grand opening” story dated Sept 27, 2018 describing the opening of the 50,000 sq. ft. facility at 33 Quail Road, funded by the 2016 bond initiative along with partner support.

Planned / underway expansion (2024 bond-funded):
- SVVSD’s 2024 Bond page states the bond calls for expanding the district’s “nationally-recognized Innovation Center.”
- The Innovation Center site published a post (Jan 27, 2026) describing a topping-out milestone for the Innovation Center expansion and tying the project to the 2024 bond (noting it was approved by nearly three-quarters of voters).
- SVVSD’s district magazine bond updates (2026 bond section) also describe the bond funding an expansion of the Innovation Center and that it will “double in size” (to accommodate more students).

NOTE: Some third-party sources discuss square-footage estimates and added features. The most directly attributable details above come from SVVSD/Innovation Center publications.
