Mission Statement & Strategic Priorities


The mission of St. Vrain Valley Schools is to be an exemplary school district which inspires and promotes high standards of learning and student well-being in partnership with parents, guardians and the community. This is achieved through a focus on ten strategic priorities that support the advancement of student achievement and global success


A.P. & concurrent enrollment offerings
You have indicated that you are interested in enrolling in a college course while a high school student. The State of Colorado provides several options for students who meet high school standards to begin college early. The purpose of these options is to extend what may not be offered at your high school. The final grade received will appear on the district’s official high school and postsecondary transcripts.  To enroll at an eligible post-secondary institution, a student must have completed the minimum course prerequisites and all required assessments. 
Please complete the following checklist each year, and observe the important dates and deadlines in the table below.
   1. Meet with your School Counselor – Your counselor can share information about the Concurrent Enrollment Program that allows students who have exhausted high school course options to concurrently enroll in postsecondary courses. Your counselor will examine your ICAP to approve moving forward with postsecondary courses or other challenging courses that align with your plan.
   2. Prerequisites – Consult your counselor and the college about testing accommodations and any course prerequisites that may be required.
   3. Complete Your College Application – Students must apply to the approved SVVSD college partner (s) that they plan to take courses with.
   4. Register for your Course(s) – Once you have completed this checklist and have spoken to your counselor and confirmed the courses have been added to your schedule, you will need to register at the college of choice for your course(s), pay any fees (if applicable), and purchase your textbooks. If you are enrolling in a Front Range class at a St. Vrain site, you may skip this step, but be aware that there may be fees associated with these courses and you will be responsible for these.
   5. Sign up for the College Opportunity Fund – The College Opportunity Fund (COF) stipend pays a portion of your total in-state tuition when you attend a Colorado public institution or a participating private institution. The stipend is paid on a per credit hour basis to the institution at which you are enrolled and will be deducted from the designated COF fund.  The college will bill you if you do not complete this step, most college applications allow a checkbox for them to complete this on your behalf.
   6. Payment – The District will pay your tuition, minus Colorado Opportunity Fund (COF).  The District is not responsible for payment of any additional fees other than tuition.  Additional fees owed to the college must be paid directly to the college and are the student’s responsibility.  Please note that this takes time and you may see a balance due up to halfway through the semester, DO NOT PAY.
AP Students

Contact your school’s AP Coordinator with any questions




"What is your favorite thing about St. Vrain?"
My favorite part of the St. Vrain Valley School District (SVVSD) is how it has fundamentally redefined the "ceiling" of what a public school education can provide. While many districts focus on meeting standard benchmarks, SVVSD operates more like a high-growth innovation hub. The most striking example of this is the Innovation Center, a 50,000-square-foot facility where students don't just learn about the future—they build it. You’ll find high schoolers working on underwater robotics for the Navy, designing cybersecurity defenses, or piloting drones, often earning professional certifications and "real-world pay" before they even receive their diplomas.
Beyond the tech, there is a palpable sense of "community momentum" that is rare in a district of this size. Whether it’s through the P-TECH programs (where students earn a free Associate degree alongside their high school diploma) or the P-TEACH initiative (which grows the next generation of educators from within their own classrooms), the district has created a pipeline of success that feels personal. It’s that combination of high-tech ambition and small-town heart—the "St. Vrain Storm"—that makes it stand out as a national model for what modern education should look like.




Special Education Resources/Supports; Gifted/Talented Supports; ESL Supports
Special education has been a federally mandated program to serve educationally disabled children, ages 3 to 21, since passage of Public Law 94-142, also known as the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (EHA) in 1975, and preauthorized and re-titled in 1990 as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). As a result of this mandate, the St. Vrain Valley School District (SVVSD) presently provides education services for students identified as having mild to profound disabilities.
The identification of an educational disability and the necessary services to be provided to address the student’s needs is a function of a “staffing” process.  The staffing involves parents, school administrators, regular education teacher(s), special education personnel and the student when appropriate. An Individual Education Plan (IEP) for the student is developed by the staffing team and reviewed yearly with modification made if needed.
It is SVVSD’s philosophy that students with disabilities should be educated with their peers in their neighborhood school unless their needs are better addressed through a more specialized educational environment. St. Vrain offers a continuum of services delivered by special education staff members ranging from consultation with regular education teachers to varying amounts of direct services to students with disabilities depending on need. These support services are provided through building level special education staff and itinerated related service providers (i.e. speech/language, occupational therapists, etc.)

Teacher planning time
Planning time in St. Vrain Valley School District (SVVSD) is a structured part of the contractual day, governed by the agreement between the district and the St. Vrain Valley Education Association (SVVEA).
The district operates on a 7-hour contract day, and planning time is generally "individual and teacher-directed," meaning it is protected for your own lesson prep, grading, and administrative tasks rather than being entirely consumed by meetings.
1. Elementary Planning Time
   * Daily Minimum: Elementary teachers typically receive at least 45 continuous minutes of individual planning time during the student day. This usually occurs while students are at "specials" (Art, Music, PE, or Library).
   * Late Start Days: On the district's monthly Late Start Wednesdays, elementary teachers are guaranteed an additional 45-minute continuous plan period within the morning block before students arrive.
   * Collaboration: While most planning is individual, schools may schedule specific blocks for grade-level "Professional Learning Communities" (PLCs) to discuss data and curriculum.
2. Secondary Planning Time (Middle & High School)
   * Schedule Alignment: Planning time at the secondary level is "commensurate with scheduled class time."
   * If the school is on a Block Schedule (90-minute periods), teachers generally have one full block for planning every other day.
   * If the school is on a Traditional Schedule (45–50 minute periods), teachers typically have one period of planning daily.
   * Late Start Days: Secondary teachers receive at least 45 minutes of teacher-directed collaboration or planning time during Late Start mornings.
   * High School Load: Most high school teachers teach five out of seven periods (or three out of four blocks), leaving the remaining time for planning and lunch.
________________


3. District-Wide "Late Start" Wednesdays
SVVSD uses a unique "Late Start" system (usually the first Wednesday of each month) to balance district goals with teacher needs:
   * Duration: These are 2.5-hour blocks before school starts.
   * Split Focus: Part of this time is Supervisor-Directed (school/district meetings), and part is Teacher-Directed (individual planning or team collaboration).
