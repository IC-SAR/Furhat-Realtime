{"text": "Title: Our Story – Innovation Center of St. Vrain Valley Schools\n\nURL: https://innovation.svvsd.org/about/our-story/\n\nStudent learning at the Innovation Center transcends the traditional classroom and provides experiential opportunities that are developing today’s students into tomorrow’s leaders, innovators and changemakers. In addition to rigorous extended learning and mentorship opportunities, students gain valuable experience through employment that focuses on designing and engineering technology solutions for industry and community partners.\nIn providing real work for real pay, offering professional/technical certifications for advanced careers, and supporting the excellent coursework at each of our focus high schools, the Innovation Center (IC) offers a distinct and unique competitive advantage for the students in our district. This iconic building provides an agile space for the intentional collision of ideas and projects and, therefore, an ideal space for innovation.\nWe believe that where you learn matters, and the IC was designed in partnership with students, educators, community members, board members, and professional partners over the course of many months. IDEO, the design firm for the Innovation Center, hosted a two-day workshop with stakeholders across all of those areas in order to help us not only craft an incredible space but also sharpen programming so that both might exhibit the values and beliefs we hold about student possibility and community collaboration. The architects, Anderson Mason Dale out of Denver, added more detail and thought to that vision, and developed the professional space we now enjoy as a community. The ability of the space to change and adapt to the needs of the users mirrors the agility and adaptability we strive for as a system.\nAt the IC, we see students and educators as a catalyst for innovation in a large district. We embrace strategic risk-taking while supporting educators and learning environments throughout the district with implementation of innovations as they move toward mainstream use.\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOur History\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2012, St. Vrain applied and was awarded the Race to the Top Grant, supplementing traditional funding with an additional $16.6 million to implement STEM integration and personalized learning approaches. As part of this grant the Innovation Center was created to provide professional STEM experiences to students through industry partnerships and paid work for students. \nThe design of the Innovation Center was a natural extension of the STEM pathway at Skyline High School. In collaborating with students and families through the design process, a number of ideas surfaced that couldn’t be fully addressed with the STEM certificate. As a district, when we learn there is promise in a prototype, we seek ways to make that opportunity available across our system. The Innovation Center is a way for us to scale our response to key learnings from Skyline as well as augment the focus areas of our other excellent high schools.\nOne of the big lessons was that paid work in STEM has a range of positive benefits for students and their families. We found that many of our young people were already employed, and that if we were going to try to engage them in learning that took them away from hours in which they were currently working and earning, we were going to have to find opportunities for paid work. The opportunity for real pay meant we could engage a larger number of students in applied STEM learning. We also found that when students had paid STEM work experiences they viewed postsecondary options in a more favorable light. Even with scholarships and aid, the opportunity cost of delaying full-time work and earnings to pursue college often did not resonate as well. However, students benefit from a new understanding that postsecondary education is a viable way to gain skills that could result in increased earnings. The paid work made the idea of skillbuilding leading to increased earning clear and tangible.\nAs a result, the Innovation Center was designed to expand the number and types of paid work experiences available across our district, as well as provide coursework and certifications that would provide our students a distinct, competitive advantage. Programming was designed to align with industry demand and culminate in professional credentials, certifications, and college credits wherever possible. Those certificates and credits communicate to a student that they have a set of skills that industry values, which helps them make the connection between learning, skill-building, earning, and success. They also ensure that if a student does not immediately continue into postsecondary, they have an excellent opportunity to acquire jobs within and beyond our network of employer partners.\nThis idea of paid work embedded in industry is also what inspired us to launch our first P-TECH program, FalconTech. In P-TECH, we have the ability to keep students in our system a little longer (up to 14th grade), pay for their first round of college coursework through a targeted Associate degree pathway, and ensure extended paid work experience in industry.\nCurrently, the Innovation Center offers 19 advanced courses and multiple industry-level professional certifications, and pays over 100 student designers for their work after school. \n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tAvailable Technologies\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Innovation Center offers experience in a wide variety of technologies including: aeronautics, bioscience, robotics, technical certifications for both Apple and PC, Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality, TV Production, Entrepreneurship, Cyber Security and Artificial Intelligence. \nWe also offer the following industry recognized certifications:\n\nUAS Pilot Certification (Aeronautics)\nFAA Fundamentals of Instructing (Aeronautics)\nFAA Advanced Ground Instructor Certification (Aeronautics)\nGeographic Information System (GIS)  (Biosciences)\nColorado River Watch (Biosciences)\nBACE Certificate (Biosciences)\nCertified Entry Level Python Programming Certification (PCEP) (Cybersecurity)\nLinux Essential (Cybersecurity)\nTriCaster Operator Certification (Video Arts)\nAWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (Information & Communications Technology)\nArtificial Intelligence Certification (Robotics)", "metadata": {"url": "https://innovation.svvsd.org/about/our-story/", "title": "Our Story – Innovation Center of St. Vrain Valley Schools", "headings": [{"level": 1, "text": "Our Story"}, {"level": 2, "text": "Recent News"}, {"level": 2, "text": "Footer"}, {"level": 3, "text": "Quick Links"}, {"level": 3, "text": "Featured Links"}, {"level": 3, "text": "Quick Links"}, {"level": 3, "text": "Featured Links"}]}}

Those two projects were Remind and FetchAFriend. Below you will find a brief synopsis for both projects. \nRemind – An AI-powered support system designed to help dementia patients fill in memory gaps, empowering both patients and caregivers with greater independence and improving daily quality of life. FetchAFriend – A thoughtful AI tool that helps shelter dogs find their ideal human match, improving adoption outcomes and giving more animals the chance to find a loving home.\nWe’re excited to announce that FetchAFriend! won the Design Excellence Award for their project, standing out among more than 132,000 students from 103 countries across the world. Link to the WAICY page\nMany humane societies operate with limited staff and minimal tech support, making it challenging to showcase adoptable animals. FetchAFriend addresses this by providing an AI-powered website and chatbot that help shelters easily manage dog profiles and guide potential adopters toward the best match for their lifestyle and budget.\nThe goal? Fewer returns, more successful long-term adoptions, and ultimately more pets landing in the loving homes they deserve. Starting with dogs and expanding across all species, this project is just getting started. \nHuge congratulations to Rachael Pichette, Isabelle Xu, Brooklyne Pierce, Zailey Lawrence and to all of the other students that participated in the competition this year.

Beginning with foundational skills in drawing, design thinking, and 3D modeling, students learn how humans have long used images to invent, communicate, and imagine future possibilities. Through immersive world-building, hands-on model making, and early explorations in virtual and augmented environments, students develop both the technical fluency and creative empathy needed to express complex ideas with clarity and impact.\nAs students advance through the pathway, they move from foundational technique to specialized creative practice. Courses such as Design Doodling with Da Vinci, 3D Modeling Innovations, Introduction to Immersive Worlds, and The Neverending Story deepen their abilities in figure drawing, digital sculpting, animation, storyboarding, technical sketching, and narrative development. They gain experience with industry-standard software like Blender and Unreal Engine while also honing analogue skills in sculpting, drafting, woodworking, and model construction. This balanced approach ensures students become versatile makers—equally comfortable sketching a character, printing a 3D prototype, directing a storyboard sequence, or building a functional object in the shop.\nThe pathway culminates in The Keystone of Capstones, where students synthesize everything they’ve learned into a professional, portfolio-ready project. With opportunities to display work publicly, enter competitions, and prepare for college or career, students finish the pathway with both the confidence and competence to pursue fields such as graphic design, animation, game design, architecture, product design, film, illustration, and fine art. By the end of the focus area journey, students are not only job- and college-ready—they are creative innovators capable of shaping the future of design across physical, digital, and immersive worlds.\n\nCourse Catalog\n\nCourse Offerings\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tDesign Doodling with Da Vinci: CTE86107\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen to grades 9th-12th\nNo Prerequisites\n\nLearn to Draw Anything!  From the earliest human communities to the present day, drawing has served as a primary tool for communication, invention, and understanding.

They share their knowledge and experiences to help students learn more about a career or industry.\nWorksite Tour: A visit to a company or workplace where students get to see what it’s like to work there. Students will tour the facility, meet employees, and learn about the different jobs and tasks they do.\nJob Shadows: A work experience option where students learn about a job by walking through the workday as a shadow to a competent worker. Variations include virtual job shadows (allows an individual to observe an occupation through the use of videos) or job simulation (career exploration that allows an individual to participate and gain experience in aspects of an occupation through simulation).\nInternships: An opportunity in real world environments for exposure to the requirements of a particular occupation or industry, the work environment and the behavioral expectations for success on the job. Such work experiences are not expected to provide formal training for occupational skills, although some skills may be learned. Internships may be paid or unpaid.\nApprenticeships: An employer-driven model that combines on-the-job learning as a paid employee with related classroom instruction in order to increase an apprentice’s skill level and wages. St. Vrain offers a variety of apprenticeships, some of which are through CareerWise Colorado. These opportunities may require a three-to-four-year commitment by the student – 1 to 2 years of which are postsecondary.\nIndustry Sponsored Project Teams: The objective of an industry-sponsored project is to create a unique, high-quality educational opportunity for students, where the educational content will enhance educational objectives of the program and class to which it is assigned. Industry Sponsored Projects in any CTE program should meet state expectations to ensure a quality WBL experience for the student.\nOpen Work-Based Learning Opportunities\n\nClick here for current internship opportunities.\n\nContact Jamie Carius for information about how to get involved in work-based learning opportunities at the Innovation Center.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                        Jamie Carius                    \n\n\nInternship Facilitator \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[email protected]", "metadata": {"url": "https://innovation.svvsd.org/focus-areas/work-based-learning/", "title": "Work-Based Learning – Innovation Center of St. Vrain Valley Schools", "headings": [{"level": 1, "text": "Work Based Learning"}, {"level": 2, "text": "Opportunities for Students Include:"}, {"level": 2, "text": "Open Work-Based Learning Opportunities"}, {"level": 2, "text": "Recent News"}, {"level": 2, "text": "Footer"}, {"level": 3, "text": "Quick Links"}, {"level": 3, "text": "Featured Links"}, {"level": 3, "text": "Quick Links"}, {"level": 3, "text": "Featured Links"}, {"level": 3, "text": "Jamie Carius"}]}}

Rooted in the district’s commitment to high standards and student well-being, our program provides a platform for students to excel and thrive as transformative leaders and creators.\nWhat does VEX lead to? Elementary students who participate in VEX are introduced to basics about engineering and coding. When they enter middle school, they will have the opportunity to either take classes in both fields, participate in an extracurricular club, or do both. All SVVSD middle schools offer courses in both robotics and computer science. In addition, students of all ages have opportunities to explore both fields through summer programming at the Innovation Center.\nWhen students enter high school, their options expand to include participating in focus programs like Skyline’s STEM Academy, any of the district’s existing PTECH programs, or taking classes at the district’s Innovation Center (IC) and Career Elevation and Technology Center (CETC), many of which allow students to earn industry certifications or concurrent enrollment credits. \nAdditionally, students can participate in numerous work-based learning project teams at the Innovation Center, such as our Aquatic Robotics, Aeronautics or Drone Performance teams. All of these paid opportunities combine to provide students with authentic, client-based opportunities and help them start charting an individual career path.\nGet Involved!!

From advanced manufacturing and robotics to cybersecurity, aerospace, health sciences, and emerging technologies, the expanded facility will allow more students to access immersive, real-world learning experiences that align with high-demand careers.\n\nThe new space is intentionally designed to support collaboration, adaptability, and innovation. Open labs, specialized workspaces, and technology-rich environments will allow students to move seamlessly between disciplines, reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of today’s workforce.\n\nMore importantly, the expansion ensures that students from across the district can continue to access equitable, high-quality opportunities – regardless of their home school, reinforcing St. Vrain’s commitment to personalized pathways and student choice.\n\nWhile the steel beam now sits high above the campus, the true foundation of the project rests in the collective investment of the St. Vrain community.

{"text": "Title: Our Story – Innovation Center of St. Vrain Valley Schools\n\nURL: https://innovation.svvsd.org/about/\n\nStudent learning at the Innovation Center transcends the traditional classroom and provides experiential opportunities that are developing today’s students into tomorrow’s leaders, innovators and changemakers. In addition to rigorous extended learning and mentorship opportunities, students gain valuable experience through employment that focuses on designing and engineering technology solutions for industry and community partners.\nIn providing real work for real pay, offering professional/technical certifications for advanced careers, and supporting the excellent coursework at each of our focus high schools, the Innovation Center (IC) offers a distinct and unique competitive advantage for the students in our district. This iconic building provides an agile space for the intentional collision of ideas and projects and, therefore, an ideal space for innovation.\nWe believe that where you learn matters, and the IC was designed in partnership with students, educators, community members, board members, and professional partners over the course of many months. IDEO, the design firm for the Innovation Center, hosted a two-day workshop with stakeholders across all of those areas in order to help us not only craft an incredible space but also sharpen programming so that both might exhibit the values and beliefs we hold about student possibility and community collaboration. The architects, Anderson Mason Dale out of Denver, added more detail and thought to that vision, and developed the professional space we now enjoy as a community. The ability of the space to change and adapt to the needs of the users mirrors the agility and adaptability we strive for as a system.\nAt the IC, we see students and educators as a catalyst for innovation in a large district. We embrace strategic risk-taking while supporting educators and learning environments throughout the district with implementation of innovations as they move toward mainstream use.\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOur History\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2012, St. Vrain applied and was awarded the Race to the Top Grant, supplementing traditional funding with an additional $16.6 million to implement STEM integration and personalized learning approaches. As part of this grant the Innovation Center was created to provide professional STEM experiences to students through industry partnerships and paid work for students. \nThe design of the Innovation Center was a natural extension of the STEM pathway at Skyline High School. In collaborating with students and families through the design process, a number of ideas surfaced that couldn’t be fully addressed with the STEM certificate. As a district, when we learn there is promise in a prototype, we seek ways to make that opportunity available across our system. The Innovation Center is a way for us to scale our response to key learnings from Skyline as well as augment the focus areas of our other excellent high schools.\nOne of the big lessons was that paid work in STEM has a range of positive benefits for students and their families. We found that many of our young people were already employed, and that if we were going to try to engage them in learning that took them away from hours in which they were currently working and earning, we were going to have to find opportunities for paid work. The opportunity for real pay meant we could engage a larger number of students in applied STEM learning. We also found that when students had paid STEM work experiences they viewed postsecondary options in a more favorable light. Even with scholarships and aid, the opportunity cost of delaying full-time work and earnings to pursue college often did not resonate as well. However, students benefit from a new understanding that postsecondary education is a viable way to gain skills that could result in increased earnings. The paid work made the idea of skillbuilding leading to increased earning clear and tangible.\nAs a result, the Innovation Center was designed to expand the number and types of paid work experiences available across our district, as well as provide coursework and certifications that would provide our students a distinct, competitive advantage. Programming was designed to align with industry demand and culminate in professional credentials, certifications, and college credits wherever possible. Those certificates and credits communicate to a student that they have a set of skills that industry values, which helps them make the connection between learning, skill-building, earning, and success. They also ensure that if a student does not immediately continue into postsecondary, they have an excellent opportunity to acquire jobs within and beyond our network of employer partners.\nThis idea of paid work embedded in industry is also what inspired us to launch our first P-TECH program, FalconTech.

The students also discussed the challenges they’ve faced in translating ideas to technical application. For the 2022-2023 school year, students will pick up where they left off and start working on finalizing their projects into marketable virtual reality content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerforming minor surgery on a cockroach to help learn about the nervous system. \n\n\nControlling the nervous system of our cyborg roboroach using the Backyard Brains App.\nDuring our community event, Student Designers were working with staff of The Butterfly Pavilion to see how focused you could be while holding Rosie the Tarantula. \nPartners\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeuroscience Team Manager\nInterested in joining?

The program supports the development of workforce readiness skills.\n\nSt. Vrain Valley Schools:Industry: Public K-12 Education District Size: 33,000 studentsLongmont: Longmont, CO\n\nThe Innovation Center of St. Vrain Valley Schools is a Career and Technical Education (CTE) center that serves all St. Vrain students and delivers educational experiences that prepare them for success as “tomorrow’s leaders, innovators, and changemakers”. The program’s mission is to equip students with the skills needed for the future, offering extended learning, mentorship opportunities, and employment.\n\nRecognizing the importance of offering cybersecurity education at earlier ages, the Innovation Center sought a solution that would resonate with their district’s middle school students. The district was offering comprehensive middle school computer science classes, but didn’t have a commonly used cybersecurity program at the middle school level. They wanted to expand their offerings in these classes to put cybersecurity on the radar for students transitioning out of middle school so that they would be interested in the cybersecurity pathways available to all St. Vrain high school students.\n\nOne challenge was helping teachers unfamiliar with cybersecurity. The district wanted to offer such teachers resources and support to develop their own foundational understanding and to teach it in their classes. SurfWisely, a game-based platform designed to improve cybersecurity education through interactive learning experiences, offered St. Vrain an accessible, “out-of-the-box-ready” resource to deliver simple, middle school-level content. Additionally, SurfWisely was an active partner ready to engage with educators on an ongoing basis.\n\nAfter participating in a free trial and receiving positive feedback from teachers across 20 schools who had used the tool, the Innovation Center committed to an annual subscription to SurfWisely for interested schools and educators across St. Vrain.\n\nSurfWisely empowers our students to be informed and effective digital citizens in the modern world.\n\n-AXEL REITZIG, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF INNOVATION, SVVSD\n\nBoth St. Vrain Valley Schools and SurfWisely wanted to move at a pace that ensured success and worked for all stakeholders. By approaching developing a partnership in a systemic and intentional manner, they could respond quickly to challenges and concerns, reflect on feedback, and iterate effectively and thoughtfully.\n\nThis pilot was a successful way to measure the interest of teachers and students in exploring cybersecurity at the middle school level as well as to build a successful partnership between the Innovation Center and SurfWisely. There are many opportunities competing for education’s attention; developing this partnership in an intentional and focused manner has established a strong foundation for further growth and success.\n\nBy using sports-themed games, SurfWisely ensures that every child can envision themselves in a cybersecurity future, making the learning process both engaging and effective.\n\nFuture Ready Festival: Experience the St. Vrain Advantage\n\nSt. Vrain Valley Schools invites the community to attend the Future Ready Festival.

It is a hardware agnostic solution aimed at bringing the benefits and joys of social robots to a broad audience. The intention is to support wellness programming, education, research, entertainment or whatever makes the world a better place.\n\nSt. Vrain Valley Schools offers a continuum of services delivered by special education staff members ranging from consultation with regular education teachers to varying amounts of direct services to students with disabilities depending on need.\n\nThe Innovation Center’s (IC) Social Assistive Robotics (SAR) team joined with St. Vrain’s Special Education Department, PEERbots, and Misty Robotics to pilot the use of socially-assistive robots in classrooms across the district.\n\nThis pilot explored the use of ‘Misty’ – the lovable robot – alongside special education teachers as they engage students with special needs. Along with ‘Misty’, teachers combined the PEERbots application to create individualized packages called ‘palettes’ to engage students.\n\nBy using MISTY as a conduit to reach students emotionally, the fear of judgment and failure is reduced greatly.\n\nAt the start of 2021, four schools were selected to participate in the pilot project. Indian Peaks would join the cohort at a later date. Each school developed strong goals for specific student populations – students with diverse learning needs, including English Language Learners (ELL).\n\nTeachers from each school – along with the IC’s SAR student design team – attended two PEERbots workshops to learn more about the app’s SAR utility and how to implement programming in combination with a ‘Misty’ robot and a student’s individualized education plan or IEP. The teams continued to meet two times per month to collaborate and expand their learning.\n\nThe PEERbots app allows educators to create specific interactions – called palettes – that are designed to align with a student’s IEP. Educators pair lesson plans with palettes to ask tailored questions during learning sessions. Then gauge student responses – movement, attention span, and overall engagement.\n\nOral surveys conducted verbally by the ‘Misty’ robot were used to collect student feedback before, during, and after each engagement – categorizing their behavior in The Zones of Regulation. This mirrors St. Vrain’s current instructional procedures.\n\nAs schools utilized the Misty Robots and PEERbots software, each pilot location formulated different methodologies for using each tool. For the sake of this case study, we will focus on data accumulated by Longmont Estates Elementary (LEES).\n\nOne student who was non-verbal before interacting with MISTY has since said his first complete sentence.\n\nThe use of the Misty II robot in tandem with PEERbots software has proven to be a successful combination. Each of the four pilot locations have reported favorable results within their individual and small group settings.\n\nObserving the Substitution, Augmentation, Modification, Redefinition model – or SAMR – as well as the Technology Integration Matrix (TIM) used throughout St. Vrain, the Innovation Center will organize its overall findings and prepare for a pilot expansion.

Longs Peak Hospital and specialty practices throughout the Rocky Mountain region have rapidly gained a reputation for excellence – combining academic-based and community-focused medicine, with leading-edge technology and innovation.\n\nThrough a partnership between the Innovation Center (IC) of St. Vrain Valley Schools and UCHealth, bioscience students were challenged to create the ‘Hospital Room of the Future’ by utilizing the design thinking process.\n\nBetween September 2019 and May 2021, students empathized with UCHealth staff, visited multiple healthcare locations, designed solutions for existing challenges, and presented their findings to regional leaders withinthe UCHealth system.\n\nDuring this project, students, teachers, and healthcare professionals hoped to:\n\nStudents studied the challenges faced by healthcare today and explored ways to create new solutions by approaching a challenge using the scientific process.\n\nEach and every division of the Innovation Center encompasses some level of design thinking. During this project, our bioscience, student designers walked through each phase – Empathy, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test – to develop a solution for the identified challenge.\n\nBefore identifying a problem to tackle, teams engaged in the first phase of the design thinking process – EMPATHY.\n\nUCHealth allowed student designers to tour Longs Peak Hospital – located in Longmont, CO – to learn more about the medical and hospital system.\n\nThey visited multiple areas within the hospital including patient rooms surgical suites, ERs, and birthing suites. Students gathered information about medical care within hospitals by talking with patients, doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff.\n\nStudents also visited the UCHealth Virtual Health Center – located in Aurora, CO – to gather information about virtual health, a growing sector of healthcare focused on telehealth, sensor use cases, and other innovative technologies.\n\nStudents then DEFINED a specific problem they observed during the empathy phase and began to IDEATE how to remedy the problem. This involved intense research and brainstorming sessions with their teams. As student designers, employed by the Innovation Center, project team members were paid $15/hr to develop this research.\n\nIn the Spring of 2021, students were then prepared to build the final PROTOTYPES of their designs. Teams selected various ways to demonstrate solutions.\n\nThroughout the project, teams were able to TEST their theories alongside healthcare experts. One example involved a visit to the UCHealth Innovation Center. Teams met with experts, pitched their ideas, answered questions, got feedback, and discussed next steps.\n\nAt the end of the 2020-2021 school year, the four teams that had met off and on for a year and a half were finally prepared to defend their prototypes in front of UCHealth’s upper echelon of innovative technology, marketing, medicine, and operations.\n\nIn the end, Team C.U.T.E. and their autonomous food delivery system came away with the highest honors from UCHealth professionals.\n\nThis project has allowed me to engage with my passion for science and medicine in a unique, REAL-WORLD way and gain a new perspective into these topics as I learned to empathize with the situations of both patients and medical staff.", "metadata": {"url": "https://innovation.svvsd.org/2022/01/03/hospital-room-of-the-future-2/", "title": "Hospital Room of the Future – Innovation Center of St. Vrain Valley Schools", "headings": [{"level": 1, "text": "Hospital Room of the Future"}, {"level": 2, "text": "January 3, 2022Updated on January 4, 2022"}, {"level": 2, "text": "The Partners"}, {"level": 2, "text": "The Goals"}, {"level": 2, "text": "The Process"}, {"level": 2, "text": "The Outcomes"}, {"level": 2, "text": "Contact Us"}, {"level": 2, "text": "Recent News"}, {"level": 2, "text": "Footer"}, {"level": 3, "text": "Quick Links"}, {"level": 3, "text": "Featured Links"}, {"level": 3, "text": "Quick Links"}, {"level": 3, "text": "Featured Links"}]}}

(FCI) is an employee-owned corporation specializing in providing the best construction management, general contracting, and construction related services with the highest level of client satisfaction.\n\nFounded in 1978 in Grand Junction, Colorado, our success was steadily built one satisfied client and successful project at a time. Today, FCI is noticed as one of the premier contractors in the Rocky Mountain region and southwestern United States.\n\nAMD Architects is a 60-person design firm based in Denver, Colorado for more than 45 years. We have provided a full range of services including the planning, programming, and design of buildings for colleges, universities, schools, libraries, justice facilities, office buildings, cultural venues, and housing. We have been awarded the American Institute of Architects’ Firm Award for “a distinguished body of work” three times and have received numerous local, regional and national design awards.\n\nAt the cross-over of creative arts and computing, the Creative Computing and Design Pathway of the Innovation Center (IC) provides students with opportunities to utilize augmented reality, virtual reality, and other modern technologies and bring their design ideas to life.\n\nBetween November 2019 and May 2021, students worked alongside professionals from FCI Constructor, Inc and AMD Architects to digitally reproduce the exterior and interior specifications of the IC. Students then developed an interactive tour — including various media — within the environment to showcase coursework and student-led projects\n\nDuring this project, students, teachers, and professionals hoped to:\n\nWe thought we were just building a school, but we ended up BUILDING SO MUCH MORE.\n\nEach division of the Innovation Center (IC) encompasses some level of design thinking.\n\nDuring this project, our student designers walked through each phase – Empathy, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test – to develop a solution for the identified challenge – How might we make the Innovation Center more accessible to those interested in learning more about programming and facilities?\n\nBefore identifying a problem to tackle, teams engaged in the first phase of the design thinking process – EMPATHY.\n\nStudents designers held initial conversations with AMD architects and FCI construction managers to better understand schematics, blueprints, and the overall design/construction process. Students also visited the construction site of St. Vrain’s newly constructed Mead Elementary to get an up-close perspective of architectural design, electrical infrastructure, as well as heating and cooling. Using space and layout would prove to be an important part of their project.\n\nStudents quickly DEFINED the challenge of accessibility. Over the course of any given school year, the Innovation Center connects with several students, parents, community members, and industry partners via on-site tours. If the team could create another layer of accessibility – beyond on-site tours – more stakeholders could learn what the IC has to offer and potentially engage with programming. The team then began to IDEATE how to createnew touch points with the IC. Video came to mind, but the obvious choice was a combination of augmented and virtual reality.\n\nIn the Winter of 2020, students partnered with AMD and mentors in Dublin to collect and PROTOTYPE 360° and virtual information modeling (VIM) of the Innovation Center’s exterior and interior space. With these resources, students developed interactive tours within the Engage VR platform. Each experience incorporated mixed media – student artwork, time lapse video, photos, and staff interviews.\n\nNear the completion of the project, students were able to produce two drafts of virtual tours – one to serve the needs of the IC and another to serve as a promotional tool for FCI. To TEST their work, the student designers premiered their virtual tours with parents and a limited amount of FCI employees.\n\nThe project officially wrapped up in May of 2021, when the team delivered the final presentation to FCI’s leadership team.\n\nThe application is currently being used by FCI at career fairs to demonstrate the capabilities of the Innovation Center. By emphasizing new technologies and use cases, the group hopes to bridge students who have interests in these studies with career paths more associated with construction and architecture.\n\nAxel Reitzig, Innovation Coordinator[email protected]\n\nFuture Ready Festival: Experience the St. Vrain Advantage", "metadata": {"url": "https://innovation.svvsd.org/2022/01/03/engaged-virtual-environments/", "title": "Engaged, Virtual Environments – Innovation Center of St. Vrain Valley Schools", "headings": [{"level": 1, "text": "Engaged, Virtual Environments"}, {"level": 2, "text": "January 3, 2022Updated on February 21, 2025"}, {"level": 2, "text": "The Partners"}, {"level": 2, "text": "The Goals"}, {"level": 2, "text": "The Process"}, {"level": 2, "text": "The Outcomes"}, {"level": 2, "text": "Contact Us"}, {"level": 2, "text": "Recent News"}, {"level": 2, "text": "Footer"}, {"level": 3, "text": "Quick Links"}, {"level": 3, "text": "Featured Links"}, {"level": 3, "text": "Quick Links"}, {"level": 3, "text": "Featured Links"}]}}

As a former member of the Saint Vrain Valley School District Robotics Leadership Team for 7 years, I successfully guided over 100 competitive robotics teams, consistently achieving top placements at State and global competitions like the VEX Robotics World Championships. My 10 year tenure as a robotics educator at Westview Middle School in Longmont, Colorado, allowed me to teach and develop programs in VEX Robotics, Python programming, and technology exploration, setting a strong foundation in both the theoretical and practical aspects of technology and engineering.\n\nIn the fall of 2023, I embarked on a new journey as a UAS Drone Instructor at the Innovation Center, focusing exclusively on high school students. In this role, I am dedicated to teaching students how to utilize drones for employment, providing them with practical skills in drone operations, and an introduction to aeronautics. My efforts include the innovative use of camera, thermal, and LIDAR drone systems where the students apply real world skills on actual job sites for companies in Longmont.\n\nAdditionally, I am spearheading the creation of a Drone Performance Team, which will be responsible for orchestrating elaborate nighttime drone shows using up to 300 drones. In partnership with industry professionals from Firefly Drone Systems, we are providing an unparalleled opportunity for students across our entire district to learn how to design and execute these shows. This collaboration not only enhances the technological skills of our students but also opens pathways to future careers in drone technology and aeronautics, equipping them to meet the challenges of tomorrow head-on.\n\nFuture Ready Festival: Experience the St. Vrain Advantage\n\nSt. Vrain Valley Schools invites the community to attend the Future Ready Festival.

The team is looking for students who can easily work with others as well as contribute their individual talents to the team, complete their work on time, and commit to attending every meeting.  As a member of the team, developers will learn new skills and knowledge, beginning with neuroscience. \n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tPast Projects\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UC Health VR Neuroscience Team merges Virtual Reality technologies with cognitive neuroscience to develop innovative ways to increase joy, empathy, and connection in teens in a post-pandemic world. Through extensive mentorship with social VR firm Rendever, local health giant UCHealth and other partners, students learn about how the brain interacts with the world through complex socio-emotional cues. This knowledge is then applied to film and develop VR prototypes that are shared with students throughout the district. Students also gain experience with 360° videography and GoPro cameras.\nOther partnerships include Rendever and their commitment in making high tech simple and accessible in order for all people to build mentally healthy relationships. As a member of this team, you will work with members from UCHealth and Rendever, as well as SVVSD staff to develop and test a virtual reality application prototype, with a focus on joy, empathy and connection. You will also apply principles of human-centered design thinking and develop a mindset of social entrepreneurship\n\n. \n\n2021-2022 school year:\nUCHealth and the Innovation Center of St. Vrain Valley Schools have partnered on a two year project focused on the use of virtual reality to build joy, empathy and connection among high school peer groups. Innovation Center students are using design thinking to create meaningful virtual reality experiences they hope will eventually be used in real life settings with their peers.\nSt. Vrain and UCHealth experts along with virtual reality partner, Rendever, have provided mentors to the students to understand more about neuroscience, mindfulness, and virtual reality content design. Essentially, getting the right experts in the room with the students so they can go dream, think and create.\nThe “prototype unveiling” event in May 2022, showcased the “why” behind each project and allowed the students to explain the process and development of their prototypes – from design thinking to content design. The students also discussed the challenges they’ve faced in translating ideas to technical application. For the 2022-2023 school year, students will pick up where they left off and start working on finalizing their projects into marketable virtual reality content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerforming minor surgery on a cockroach to help learn about the nervous system. \n\n\nControlling the nervous system of our cyborg roboroach using the Backyard Brains App.\nDuring our community event, Student Designers were working with staff of The Butterfly Pavilion to see how focused you could be while holding Rosie the Tarantula. \nPartners\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeuroscience Team Manager\nInterested in joining?

Mentoring was also found to boost self-confidence, enhance skills, and contribute to a sense of belonging within a future professional field (Bruce & Bridgeland, 2014).  Your work with our students provides opportunities for students to gain valuable insight into potential academic and career paths.  Our mentors are encouraged to share their industry experiences and passion for their particular STEM disciplines with our students.  Project teams rely on mentors to share valuable skills and guide mentees through the stages of our district-adopted design process.  Mentor/mentee relationships give students many opportunities to improve self-confidence, develop a willingness to take risks, persevere through problem-solving, and acquire and apply essential technical skills while earning, participating in projects, and creating solutions. Mentoring at the ICOur mentors are an essential part of our programming and allow us to provide students with access to the expertise of STEM industry professionals. Mentor involvement at our facility provides a vital link between the industry workforce and public education communities.We recognize the vital role of industry mentors in providing valuable resources for workforce readiness education. Mentors are crucial to the preparation of our students for the professional world. We invite you to discover the variety of ways industry professionals participate in our programs.Getting StartedThe Innovation Center offers mentors flexibility in their interactions with project teams. Depending on various circumstances, mentor participation can be facilitated in the following formats:Virtual – In some cases mentors may need to interact with teams online through video conferencing.In-person – Mentors will come to the IC to work with students in person.Blended – Depending on the situation, there may be opportunities for teams to combine virtual and in-person mentor participation.There are many ways to participate in mentoring at the IC.

Trujillo dedicated his summer to an intensive three-month block of coursework, and by the second day of his junior year, he had already earned the advanced certification along with one elective credit. His accomplishment not only reflects exceptional skill and determination, but also sets him apart as one of the youngest to achieve this level of success as most who take the exam have already started college.\n\nRather than being intimidated by the challenge, Trujillo turned preparation into a personal passion. Over the past summer, he dedicated three to four hours a day to studying with videos, labs, and quizzes, filling a notebook by hand to master the material. “Even flashcards became a game for me – I reviewed almost 200 a day,” he said. “It was a huge undertaking, but I quickly learned to stop doubting myself.”\n\nTrujillo is the first St. Vrain Valley Schools student to earn the CCNA, an achievement made possible through Opportunity CLIMB, a program funded in part by Colorado’s Opportunity Now Grant. The initiative rewards competency rather than time spent in the classroom, while also covering exam costs and providing mentorship, resume workshops, and networking support. “It’s both technical and professional development – you learn how to get a job, not just how to pass a test,” Trujillo said.\n\nAccording to Jorge Cisneros, an Opportunity CLIMB facilitator, “Jacob showed what’s possible when passion drives learning.” Trujillo’s achievement embodies the purpose of the Opportunity CLIMB program and highlights a central pillar of the St. Vrain Advantage – ensuring every student has the chance to excel. Opportunity CLIMB program coordinator Eryn Mercer-Niehues emphasized that St. Vrain’s innovative approach continues to create new pathways for student success. “Programs like Opportunity CLIMB open doors for students to reach levels they may never have imagined possible,” she said.\n\nLooking ahead, Trujillo plans to attend Front Range Community College to continue a certification-driven pathway into technology, while expanding into security certifications. His accomplishment not only reflects his own dedication but also underscores how the right blend of mentorship and opportunity can accelerate student success. As more learners follow in his footsteps, Trujillo’s story serves as a reminder of the transformative impact of investing in students’ passions and future careers.\n\nFuture Ready Festival: Experience the St. Vrain Advantage\n\nSt. Vrain Valley Schools invites the community to attend the Future Ready Festival.

Research consistently shows that when students have access to their personal devices during instructional time, it can significantly inhibit their ability to engage deeply with lessons, collaborate effectively with peers, and develop the sustained attention skills essential for academic success.\n\nIt’s important to distinguish between different types of screen time. While we embrace technology as a powerful learning tool—using iPads for interactive lessons, computers for research projects, and educational apps that enhance understanding—personal device usage often involves social media, games, and messaging that can fragment a student’s attention and disrupt the learning environment for everyone.\n\nTo create the focused, engaging classrooms our students deserve, we’ve established clear guidelines for cell phone and personal device use:\n\nThese expectations apply to all personal devices, including smartwatches and other wearables.\n\nWe believe in teaching responsibility through clear, progressive consequences that help students learn from their choices:\n\nFor Elementary Students: We partner closely with families from the first incident, ensuring parents are informed and involved in helping their child understand expectations.\n\nFor Secondary Students: We start with reminders and short-term consequences, escalating only when students need additional support to meet expectations.\n\nIn all cases, our goal is education and growth, not punishment. We want students to develop self-regulation skills that will serve them throughout their lives.\n\nYour support at home makes all the difference. When families and schools work together to establish consistent expectations about technology use, students are more successful. Here are ways you can partner with us:\n\nIn our classrooms, students regularly engage with technology for research, creativity, collaboration, and problem-solving. These are the digital literacy skills that will serve them in college, careers, and life. By creating focused learning environments during school hours, we’re helping students develop the concentration, critical thinking, and interpersonal skills they need to thrive in an increasingly complex world.\n\nWe understand that every family situation and values related to cell phone usage is unique, and we’re committed to working with you to address any concerns or special circumstances. Please do not hesitate to reach out to your child’s teacher, school administrator, or our district office if you have questions about our expectations or how they affect your student.\n\nThank you for your partnership in creating exceptional learning experiences for all our students. Together, we’re helping them develop the skills, knowledge, and habits that will serve them for a lifetime.\n\nFuture Ready Festival: Experience the St. Vrain Advantage\n\nSt. Vrain Valley Schools invites the community to attend the Future Ready Festival.

Students who continue educational activities over the break return to school better prepared and confident. Our Summer Learning Liftoff program is designed to support your child’s ongoing growth with engaging and enjoyable activities that reinforce key skills.\n\nAll K-12 students will bring home their iPads over summer break, providing access to the digital tools and resources used throughout the school year. These devices allow students to utilize curriculum options highlighted on St. Vrain’s Summer Learning Liftoff page, which offers grade-level activities designed to reinforce key concepts from the past year and preview learning for the year ahead. These resources are designed to help students stay engaged, curious, and prepared for a strong start in August.\n\nFamilies can explore early summer activities now to review familiar material and build new skills. A reminder email will be sent in July, sharing Summer Learning Liftoff resources that focus on late summer activities in preparation for the new school year.\n\nTo support families, our Family Resources for iPad Support page includes how-to guides for using your student’s iPad, tips for healthy digital habits, affordable internet options, and more.\n\nThese activities are optional, and if you as a parent do not want your child to access the iPad throughout the summer, please contact your school building principal and you can drop off the iPad at the school.\n\nWe wish all our families a safe and enjoyable summer break and encourage you to take advantage of these resources to keep learning going and prepare for the year ahead.\n\nFuture Ready Festival: Experience the St. Vrain Advantage\n\nSt. Vrain Valley Schools invites the community to attend the Future Ready Festival.

They are omnivorous; feeding on a combination of algae, vegetation, small invertebrates. The species is a sight-feeder, meaning they exclusively rely their sense of sight to hunt and eat. This means certain water quality characteristics such as temperature and turbidity are crucial to the success of this species in an environment.\nThe Colorado population has been significantly impacted by habitat disruption (dams and human activity), large predatory fish species, like trout, bass, pike, and sunfish, and changing temperatures. \nIn 2015, Colorado Parks and Wildlife designated the NRD as a “Tier 1: Species of Greatest Conservation Need.”\nThe Innovation Center in collaboration with Ocean’s First Institute, Boulder County, Boulder County Parks and Open Space Foundation, Colorado Parks and Wildlife, and the Denver Zoo has formed a Northern Redbelly Dace Recovery program which aims to increase public awareness and peak student interest in the conservation of native species. The primary goal of the recovery project is to expand the range of healthy Northern Redbelly Dace populations in the state of Colorado and beyond. \nThrough this project, we have included students and community volunteers to help increase the success rate of this endeavor which includes facilitating a yearly fish-release and creating a system for continued data collection.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLesson Plan and Activities \nBelow your will find links to the lesson plans and materials that our students have  developed as well as some activities. \nPresentation – Northern Redbelly DaceLesson Plan – Northern Redbelly Dace – Story of ConservationActivity – Northern Redbelly DaceHabitat Activity – Northern Redbelly Dace\nNorthern Redbelly Dace Comic Book \nCheck out our student created comic book below that highlights the efforts on the Northern Redbelly Dace Recovery Project. \n\n\n\n\nAwards\n\nWorld Affair’s Challenge Winners: Taryn McDermid & Anya Wieder\n\n\nRISE Challenge Colorado\n\nData science students touring the City of Longmont Water Quality Lab\nAdditional Content and Resources\nArcGIS StorymapConservation Presentation", "metadata": {"url": "https://innovation.svvsd.org/nrd/", "title": "Northern Redbelly Dace – Innovation Center of St. Vrain Valley Schools", "headings": [{"level": 2, "text": "A Conservation Effort: Northern Redbelly Dace"}, {"level": 2, "text": "Lesson Plan and Activities"}, {"level": 2, "text": "Northern Redbelly Dace Comic Book"}, {"level": 2, "text": "Awards"}, {"level": 2, "text": "Additional Content and Resources"}, {"level": 2, "text": "Recent News"}, {"level": 2, "text": "Footer"}, {"level": 3, "text": "Quick Links"}, {"level": 3, "text": "Featured Links"}, {"level": 3, "text": "Quick Links"}, {"level": 3, "text": "Featured Links"}]}}

This international event, focused on K-12 cybersecurity education, brought together representatives from the United States, India, Japan, and Australia to advance awareness and engagement in cybersecurity among young students. Students joined the Innovation Center’s own National Cybersecurity Teacher of the Year, Ms. Beth Cerrone. The event underscored the need to create educational pathways that prepare students for the growing demands of the cybersecurity workforce.\n\nMs. Cerrone has been a driving force behind SVVSD’s thriving cybersecurity program at the Innovation Center. Her leadership and dedication have provided students with invaluable real-world cybersecurity experiences, enabling them to gain skills essential for their futures in a high-demand industry. Representing SVVSD alongside Ms. Cerrone were Silver Creek High School senior Kaylee Crouthamel and Niwot High 2024 graduate and current Colorado State University student, Sienna Arellano.\n\nReflecting on her experience, Sienna Arellano said, “This entire experience was inspiring and eye-opening for what I want to do in the future and who I want to become within the field of cybersecurity.” Having started her cybersecurity journey in middle school with CyberPatriot, Sienna has since flourished in the field, thanks to the guidance and mentorship of Ms. Cerrone and the resources available through SVVSD’s Innovation Center.\n\nDuring the White House event, Sienna and Kaylee had the chance to share their journey into cybersecurity, as well as discuss their most impactful project—working with over 150 local senior citizens to improve their cybersecurity awareness and help protect them from online dangers. “Knowing the work I was doing was helping save vulnerable people from online dangers was incredibly rewarding,” Sienna shared. This experience highlighted not only the importance of cybersecurity skills but also their potential to make a real difference in communities.\n\nWhile sharing her story and engaging with her peers was fulfilling, Sienna described her interactions with cybersecurity professionals at the White House as a true highlight. “Meeting incredible cybersecurity experts like Cyber and AI strategist Dr. Safi Mojidi and Senior Advisor for Cybersecurity Michael Klein opened my eyes to the limitless possibilities in the field,” she said. “Listening to their stories and hearing about their day-to-day lives in cybersecurity furthered my excitement to launch down this path.”\n\nAs cybersecurity grows in importance, both nationally and globally, students like Sienna and Kaylee, supported by teachers in St. Vrain, exemplifies how dedicated educators and hands-on learning environments prepare students to meet the challenges of a digital world.\n\nThrough its commitment to empowering students with future-ready skills, SVVSD is helping cultivate the next generation of cybersecurity leaders, equipped to make a difference at home and abroad.\n\nFuture Ready Festival: Experience the St. Vrain Advantage\n\nSt. Vrain Valley Schools invites the community to attend the Future Ready Festival.

The networking team has undertaken significant projects, including replacing and upgrading network software and equipment. \nOn the device support side, the team replaced all printers and provided extensive training for staff on the new equipment. A major initiative involved preparations to distribute new iPads, with plans to sell old devices to generate funds for the district and promote sustainability. They also supported new teachers by setting up laptops and iPads and training them on essential software and systems, helping them to be ready for the classroom from day one.\nDTS integrated student workers, apprentices, and interns into their summer operations, offering valuable real-world experience and mentorship opportunities. Interns have been instrumental in preparing new teachers’ technology setups, emphasizing the department’s commitment to hands-on learning and professional development for future tech professionals. “Giving the summer help teams an opportunity to see what a professional work environment looks like and being mentors to them, such as how to handle certain scenarios in the future is one of my favorite parts of our summer work” explained Sean Shepard, Lead Technical Support Analyst.\nBy conducting these extensive updates and preparations during the summer, the DTS team minimizes disruptions to the school year, providing a stable and efficient technological environment for students and staff.\n“The work we do is to ensure that we are able to provide a stable connection [and] stable resources for students and staff so their downtime is minimized, and that way their teaching and learning time is maximized,” shares Gina Lacy, Director of IT Operations and Infrastructure. “We’re constantly upgrading and evolving. Technology is changing so quickly, and we need to keep evolving to stay up with it.”\nCustodial Services\nSt. Vrain’s Custodial Services team also plays a vital role in preparing the schools for the new academic year. Over the summer, the team undertakes extensive cleaning projects, including stripping and waxing floors, extracting carpets, and deep-cleaning various areas of the buildings with specialized equipment. This thorough process makes certain that every corner of the school is pristine, from the lights and walls to the furniture and floors.\n“We want our buildings to look the absolute best that they can,” says Vi McHugh, Head Custodian at Sunset Middle School. “It sets the tone for the day so that students can have a good day and be able to learn in a nice, clean, safe environment.”\nThis summer work is crucial as it sets a high standard for cleanliness that benefits students, teachers, and staff. By completing these projects when school is not in session, the team avoids disrupting daily activities and mitigates safety risks. The impact of their efforts is evident when students and staff return to a sparkling clean environment, which not only enhances the overall appearance of the school but also creates a positive and welcoming atmosphere. A clean and well-maintained building helps set a productive tone for the school year, allowing everyone to start fresh in a safe and pleasant learning environment.\nTeachers and Professional Development\nThrough the summer months, many teachers across the district spend time taking professional development courses and engaging in other learning opportunities to help them continue to expand their knowledge and improve their craft to best serve the students that enter their classrooms.\nOne example is the Advanced Placement Summer Institute, which is a weeklong professional development course organized by CollegeBoard to give teachers who teach Advanced Placement courses additional training and resources to help their students be successful and achieve high levels of success on the exams. Summer professional development is key for keeping educators updated on the latest standards and practices. \n“It’s important for educators to be knowledgeable about current standards, pedagogies, and best practices,” shared Carlie Ekx, an English teacher at Skyline High School. Matt Samson, a social studies teacher at Longmont High School, highlighted that “summer PD helps alleviate the stress of starting a new school year and keeps teachers aware of technological advancements.”\nThese programs provide teachers with innovative strategies and resources to benefit students. Ultimately, summer professional development helps teachers meet the evolving needs of their students, creating a successful and challenging learning experience for every student.\nThe dedicated efforts of St. Vrain’s teachers, District Technology Services, and Custodial Services during the summer have made sure that St. Vrain Valley Schools are well-prepared for the new academic year. These behind-the-scenes activities create a supportive and efficient learning environment, demonstrating the district’s unwavering commitment to providing high-quality education and fostering student success. As the 2024-2025 school year approaches, the collective hard work over the summer months will undoubtedly contribute to a positive and productive year for all.", "metadata": {"url": "https://innovation.svvsd.org/2024/08/16/behind-the-scenes-of-summer-in-st-vrain-valley-schools/", "title": "Behind the Scenes of Summer in St. Vrain Valley Schools – Innovation Center of St. Vrain Valley Schools", "headings": [{"level": 1, "text": "Behind the Scenes of Summer in St. Vrain Valley Schools"}, {"level": 2, "text": "August 16, 2024Updated on August 19, 2024"}, {"level": 2, "text": "District Technology Services"}, {"level": 2, "text": "Custodial Services"}, {"level": 2, "text": "Teachers and Professional Development"}, {"level": 2, "text": "Recent News"}, {"level": 2, "text": "Footer"}, {"level": 3, "text": "Quick Links"}, {"level": 3, "text": "Featured Links"}, {"level": 3, "text": "Quick Links"}, {"level": 3, "text": "Featured Links"}]}}

Organized by a committee of high school students and educators, the parade is designed to celebrate the achievements of the district and strengthen the connection between St. Vrain Valley Schools and the community.\n\nAddison Brents, senior at Silver Creek High School shared, “We have plans to get students and teachers from every single school involved. Each school will have the opportunity to showcase something that they are passionate about and that they think represents the district in the best light.”\n\nThe parade is scheduled for Saturday, September 7 at 10:00 a.m. The parade route will begin at Roosevelt Park, proceed east on Longs Peak to Main Street, then travel south on Main Street to 4th Avenue. From there, it will go east on 4th Avenue to Kimbark Street, head north on Kimbark to Longs Peak Avenue, turn left on Longs Peak, and return to Roosevelt Park. The parade announcers’ table will be in front of the Longmont Chamber of Commerce, and spectators are encouraged to set up along this area for the best viewing locations.\n\nCarrie Adams, Silver Creek Leadership Academy Program Director and a key organizer of the parade, shared insights into the preparation and goals of the event. “We organized a committee this spring, asking each high school principal to nominate two students to represent their feeder program,” said Adams. “The students have worked tirelessly with support from staff to create and finalize the parade logo, manage logistics, and brainstorm ideas for giveaways. They’ve been instrumental in every step of the process, from creating save-the-date forms to coordinating parade entries.”\n\nThe parade is a collaboration between all schools in St. Vrain and their programs. “It will showcase special programs like the Innovation Center of St. Vrain Valley Schools and the Career Elevation and Technology Center, with entries that highlight unique aspects of each school, such as Mariachi band, P-TECH, and other focus programs,” shared Blake Baker, junior at Skyline High School.\n\n“Allowing the community to see all the amazing programs and opportunities available to all St. Vrain Valley Schools students in one place is a great thing,” Adams noted. “This parade lets the community see the span and scope of the work the school district does.

{"text": "Title: Unleashing Potential: AI and Creativity Camp at St. Vrain Valley Schools – Innovation Center of St. Vrain Valley Schools\n\nURL: https://innovation.svvsd.org/2024/06/19/unleashing-potential-ai-and-creativity-camp-at-st-vrain-valley-schools/\n\nLogin to ClassLink to access Infinite Campus and other learning applications.\n\nLogin to ClassLink to access Infinite Campus and other learning applications.\n\nThe Innovation Center of St. Vrain Valley Schools’ groundbreaking AI and Creativity Camp is transforming how students engage with technology. Through camp activities, students combine technology and creativity by exploring a range of Artificial Intelligence including AI software, art projects, 3D models, and more.\n\nOne of the standout participants in this camp is Isaac Crane, a fifth-grader at Mead Elementary who has Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 1. This genetic condition means his body cannot turn protein into muscle and he depends on various machines and technology. Isaac has used an eye-gaze enabled communication device, his “talker,” since he was 18 months old. This device functions as a PC and is integral to all his schoolwork. Despite his challenges, Isaac loves singing, playing video games with his sister, watching cartoons, reading, and being a part of Cub Scouts Pack 159. He’s also a big Marvel fan, especially of Spider-Man.\n\nIsaac’s mother, Jenna Crane, signed him up for the camp to meet new friends and to do something active over the summer, unsure of how well it would work. “After the first day, it was clear that he would be able to fully participate and complete all of the activities on his talker,” she excitedly shares. Isaac worked on projects using programs they had never tried or known about, with his para, Sarah Merritt, immediately recognizing ways he could use these programs in school.\n\nSarah emphasizes how the camp has expanded Isaac’s creative tools. “What he is producing with AI is going to be a game changer for him.” The AI tools introduced at the camp have enhanced Isaac’s ability to express his creativity and engage in activities alongside his classmates.\n\nAccording to Mai Vu, AI program manager at the Innovation Center, the camp’s primary goal is to explore the potential of co-creating with AI. “Can humans co-create with AI? That’s what this camp is trying to explore,” she says. The camp aims to provide students with access to what AI can and cannot do, fostering an environment of creativity and innovation.\n\nDuring the camp, students are learning how to use AI to generate images based on their descriptions and ideas. These AI-generated images are then used to create various artifacts, such as comic books, coloring books, and personalized T-shirts. This process not only introduces students to advanced technology but also allows them to see their creative visions come to life. Isaac, for example, was thrilled to design his own T-shirt, a project that showcased his creativity and technical skills.\n\nFor Isaac, the camp represents an opportunity to explore his interests and skills in new ways. “It’s wonderful to help him in his journey,” Mai expresses, highlighting the empowering nature of the camp.\n\nThe implications of this camp extend beyond just technical skills. Sarah recounts her excitement about the potential for this technology to enhance Isaac’s academic experience. “This will make it so that he can do presentations for his class where he can do his own illustrations,” she explains. The ability to contribute visually to his projects and presentations means Isaac can now fully engage in the creative aspects of his education.\n\nJenna Crane shared that their family’s hopes for Isaac have evolved significantly over the years. “When we enrolled him in preschool, we were almost in shock that he’d survived long enough to get to go to preschool. We approach every day as a gift, and every passing year we are so impressed with how bright, determined, and funny Isaac is.” She adds, “Now we are hopeful that he’ll get to demonstrate his knowledge and interests even more as he gets older. Technology is literally his lifeline, so seeing a glimpse of all that the Innovation Center has to offer that he could access with his eyes is just so cool.”\n\nIsaac expressed his enthusiasm for the camp, stating, “It was awesome! I got to learn new computer things, work with kids from other schools, and do something fun.” His favorite part? “Making the T-shirt!”\n\nThe AI and Creativity Camp at St. Vrain Valley Schools is a great example of how the power of public education is constantly advancing, illustrating how technology can enable students to reach their full potential. For students like Isaac, this camp is not just about learning AI; it’s about unleashing their full potential and showing the world what they are truly capable of.\n\nFuture Ready Festival: Experience the St. Vrain Advantage\n\nSt. Vrain Valley Schools invites the community to attend the Future Ready Festival.

{"text": "Title: Championing Fiscal Responsibility and a Strong Return on Investment, St. Vrain Valley Schools Lowers Rates for Property Taxes Collected in 2024 – Innovation Center of St. Vrain Valley Schools\n\nURL: https://innovation.svvsd.org/2024/02/06/championing-fiscal-responsibility-and-a-strong-return-on-investment-st-vrain-valley-schools-lowers-rates-for-property-taxes-collected-in-2024/\n\nLogin to ClassLink to access Infinite Campus and other learning applications.\n\nLogin to ClassLink to access Infinite Campus and other learning applications.\n\nChampioning Fiscal Responsibility and a Strong Return on Investment, St. Vrain Valley Schools Lowers Rates for Property Taxes Collected in 2024\n\nOver the past decade, the St. Vrain Valley has experienced significant growth and is considered one of the most desirable places for outstanding public schools, jobs in fast-growth industries, abundant outdoor recreation, and an overall high quality of life. As homes and commercial properties have become more valuable, assessed valuations have also increased. The investment of the St. Vrain Valley community into our public schools through the passage of two Mill Levy Overrides, one in 2008 and one in 2012, has continued to provide a strong financial investment and foundation that has enabled St. Vrain to become one of the state’s leading school systems – recently achieving the highest on-time graduation rate in the Denver Metro Area at 93.3%, and the lowest dropout rate at 0.6%.\n\nAs the district has continued to strengthen and advance student achievement and opportunities, it has also focused heavily on strong financial management and systems that will ensure the best use of community resources and investment. This has included debt refinancing, payment structuring, and early debt payoff strategies which has saved taxpayers approximately $82.3 million over the past two decades. This includes $36.8 million saved in December alone, a testament to the district’s conservative financial planning and its dedication to the community’s economic well-being. The $82.3 million in savings does not go back to the district for other uses, and is solely for the benefit of the taxpayers. For property taxes collected in 2024, the district continues these efforts and has reduced the property tax mill levy rate by 1.147 mills.\n\n“By judiciously managing our finances, we’ve been able to reduce the mill levy and still honor our promise to deliver a world-class education system,” said Greg Fieth, Chief Financial Officer. “This approach will also enable our community to continue to invest in our schools in a potential 2024 bond – including safety upgrades, critical infrastructure and maintenance needs, and provide classroom additions and construct new school buildings to address overcrowding and future enrollment  – without raising taxes1.”\n\nSt. Vrain voters pass bond initiatives that are paid through property taxes. Bonds are used to make investments to increase school safety, complete critical building maintenance, add classroom and instructional space, build schools, and complete other bricks and mortar infrastructure projects – they are not used for hiring, operating schools, or increasing salaries.\n\nSt. Vrain Valley Schools is currently planning to recommend that a bond initiative be placed on the 2024 ballot that will not increase property taxes1, and will represent a significant investment in advancing the future of our community. The 2024 bond will focus on: providing the education that today’s students will need for tomorrow’s jobs and careers, including skilled trades (plumbing, electrical, and construction), computer systems, cybersecurity, healthcare, and more; improving safety and security in school buildings; performing critical building maintenance and replace outdated electrical, plumbing, and HVAC systems; continuing the district’s commitment to academic excellence, safety, and accountability; and providing classroom additions and construction of new school buildings to address overcrowding and future enrollment\n\nThe St. Vrain community also continues to experience growth in both population and economic strength, increasing the number of resources available to invest in our public schools. Due to existing community investment, strong financial management, and growth in population and economic strength, the 2024 bond will not require a new school district property tax or increase district property taxes1.\n\n“It’s about fiscal responsibility and community trust,” said Dr. Don Haddad, Superintendent. “We are grateful for our community’s support and are committed to using resources in the most fiscally responsible way.”\n\nIn addition to the opportunity to pass a bond without increasing taxes for the community, the district’s strong financial position has also enabled significant investment in raising salaries for teachers, bus drivers, custodians, office professionals, campus supervisors, nutrition service workers, paraprofessionals, and so many others who support the academic success and well-being of our students. While the 2024 bond cannot be used for hiring or salaries, the district has leveraged existing resources and capitalized on the economy of scale across our large system to increase starting teacher salaries to one of the highest in Colorado.\n\n“Offering competitive salaries is not just a necessity in the face of national staff shortages; it’s an investment that directly benefits our children and the community at large,” said Dr. Don Haddad, Superintendent. “We remain deeply committed to ensure that each and every student has access to the highest quality education and the very best teachers who will support their continued growth and advancement.”\n\nThis investment in teachers and school staff also contributes to the economic strength of the community. St. Vrain Valley Schools is the largest employer in the district’s 411 square mile footprint, with approximately 5,500 employees that serve approximately 33,000 students. Further, as the district continues to see student outcomes soar – such as graduation rates, Advanced Placement class enrollments, 80% athletics and co-curricular participation rates, significant student achievements in visual and performing arts, exponential growth in competitive robotics, and so much more, the quality of the education system is contributing significantly to the quality of the overall community.\n\nHigh-quality schools provide a return on services valued in great excess of their funding.2 As a region’s quality and level of education increases, productivity, income, social stability and economic development also rise, while crime rates, health care dependence and public service costs decrease substantially.3,4,5\n\nWhen calculating the public benefits of education in terms of high school graduation rates, the net economic benefit to the public is $127,000 per high school graduate.6 For the approximately 2,000 students who graduated from a St. Vrain high school in 2023, the lifetime positive economic impact on public funds puts an additional $254 million into our communities.\n\n“Our transformational shift over the past 13 years has been focused on maximizing the returns on our community’s investments into our schools, while also giving our students a strong competitive advantage for future success,” added Dr. Haddad. “Public education is America’s most significant investment and – second only to parenting – is the greatest contributor to the future of our world. The quality of our schools impacts and strengthens our economy, public health and safety, national security, the quality of our service industry, residential and business property values, public health, our workforce pipeline, our democracy, and so much more.”\n\nWhile the full return on investment and its benefits are often not seen until decades in the future, St. Vrain will continue to invest our resources to advance the future of not only today’s generation but also tomorrow’s.\n\n1 Passage of the 2024 bond will not impose any new school district property tax and will not increase the district’s existing annual debt repayment obligation. Based on the current tax formula, it is specifically designed to not increase your existing school district taxes, and may even result in a lowering of existing property taxes, similar to the tax reduction the district made in January 2024.\n\n2 Bogart, W.T. & Cromwell, B.A. (1997).

This program is not just about providing access to Advanced Placement (AP) courses; it’s about redefining educational excellence and creating a culture of high achievement and inclusivity.\n\nAt the heart of the “AP for All” initiative is a commitment to ensure that every student in the district has the opportunity to engage in rigorous, college-level coursework.\n\nThe students of St. Vrain Valley School District eloquently express the transformative impact of AP courses on their academic and personal growth. Rebekah Vaisman’s experience encapsulates this, “It was a good challenge… and so now I’m taking three AP classes this year.” This sentiment is echoed by Cecellia Chiaravalle, who finds the “deep learning in AP classes unmatched,” highlighting the enriching academic environment fostered by the initiative.\n\nJustice Montoya’s advice to peers, “If you’ve been comfortable with a class and you’ve always performed well, I’d say go for it,” reflects the encouraging culture of the district, urging students to embrace challenges for greater growth. Similarly, Jonah Perez notes the practical benefits: “I could potentially have up to 15 credits at the end of high school, which is really good for college.”\n\nUnderstanding the challenges that come with AP courses, St. Vrain Valley Schools offer a robust support system. This includes practice exams and Saturday study sessions, which have proven effective in boosting students’ confidence and performance. The district’s approach emphasizes not just academic success, but also the development of critical life skills such as problem-solving and time management​​.\n\nAP courses in St. Vrain Valley Schools are not limited to preparing students for college. They are designed to empower students with skills necessary for a successful future, regardless of their post-high school plans. Students develop their academic potential to the highest levels, gaining confidence that will serve them well beyond their school years​​.\n\nThe district also places a strong emphasis on professional development for educators. The AP for All Summer Institute held in St. Vrain, in partnership with the Colorado Education Initiative, aims to enhance the skills of AP teachers and create more inclusive classrooms. This commitment to continuous learning and improvement among educators is a crucial component of the program’s success​​.\n\nSt. Vrain Valley Schools offer a wide range of AP courses, ensuring that there is something for every student’s interest and academic goals. The recognition of several high schools in the district on the College Board AP School Honor Roll underscores a district-wide commitment to academic excellence. Chris Gardner, St. Vrain’s Assessment Coordinator adds, “In St. Vrain, we offer 36 AP courses across all of our high schools including New Meridian, St. Vrain Virtual High School, and the LaunchEd Virtual Academy. If a student is at a particular high school that does not offer an AP course that they want to take, they can enroll at another high school just for that course, or through the St. Vrain AGILE program to get access to that course.”\n\nThe “AP for All” initiative in the St. Vrain Valley School District is a shining example of what can be achieved when a district commits to both high academic standards and inclusivity. By providing broad access to challenging AP courses and ensuring the necessary support for students to succeed, St. Vrain is preparing its students not just for college, but for life. The district’s approach to education, focusing on both academic rigor and holistic development, sets a benchmark for others to follow.\n\nFor further details, explore the St. Vrain Valley Schools website: AP, AP for All teacher workshops, and St. Vrain High Schools achieving recognition on the College Board’s Advanced Placement School Honor Roll. These resources provide an in-depth look at the district’s innovative approach to education and its commitment to excellence for all students.\n\nFuture Ready Festival: Experience the St. Vrain Advantage\n\nSt. Vrain Valley Schools invites the community to attend the Future Ready Festival.

AI can help solve monumental issues like cancer, but it’s imperative to educate our future leaders about its limitations and possibilities.”\n\nBacked by the Innovation Center, Malcolm Smith’s project VexID was designed to aid young learners in understanding robotics parts through AI-driven tools, and showcased both creativity and practicality, earning him recognition among participants worldwide.\n\n“I built a tool that will help kids learn robotics parts for like kids’ robotics,” Smith said. “Once you have a project, you make a three-minute presentation on it, you present it to the judges, and then we’re evaluated against other students worldwide who are doing the same thing.”\n\nRight before a “Day of AI” at the Innovation Center, Vu brought a handful of her students together to present to the judges via video chat in a conference room upstairs and doted over them like a caring mother as she ushered them through the process.\n\n“We’re not just teaching AI; we’re fostering critical thinking. AI empowers knowledge, but critical thinking is the key to solving future problems,” Vu said. “This is what the competition’s about. We are building a pathway to AI, empowering kids to solve real-world problems.”\n\nThe afternoon’s event featured a variety of activities aimed at engaging, educating and inspiring attendees about AI. During the event, participants explored various facets of AI through interactive stations, which included AWS DeepRacer, Google’s Quick Draw Game, Generative Art and an introduction to ChatGPT.\n\nSessions covered topics such as “Demystifying AI,” and attendees learned about St. Vrain’s efforts to support teachers in effectively incorporating AI into their teaching and classrooms. Hands-on STEM activity stations and the Future-Ready Innovation Mobile Lab were available for all ages to explore, and the evening concluded with an outdoor drone light show.\n\nThe day of AI also coincided with WAICY and attendees had the opportunity to observe students presenting their solutions for real-world problems using AI before the light show in the main lecture hall.\n\nWith VexID, the image classifier-based robotics kit, Smith aimed to enhance accessibility. Addressing the challenge of machine learning, which requires vast amounts of data, Smith wrote a program to generate simulated pieces, producing over 30,000 diverse images. He integrated a shield that encoded depth information into images, enhancing the model’s understanding of varying perspectives.\n\nFuture Ready Festival: Experience the St. Vrain Advantage\n\nSt. Vrain Valley Schools invites the community to attend the Future Ready Festival.

Beyond the pivotal task of being ball shaggers, these students get a chance to immerse themselves in the tournament’s vibrant atmosphere, including personal interactions with the players.\n\nThe program, which was initially brought to life by Diane Ruby, a former teacher and coach at Longmont High School, is currently spearheaded by Josh Law, a Physical Education teacher at Mountain View Elementary. With about 17 years of involvement and nearly a decade of organizing and leading the program, Law continues to foster a spirit of participation and learning among the students.\n\nEach year, around 200 students from 12 schools participate, including Westview, Longs Peak, Trail Ridge, and others. These students are not just part of the logistical flow of the game; they are immersed in the event’s ambiance. One of the highlights for many students is the opportunity to meet the volleyball players. These interactions often culminate in students getting their shirts signed by the athletes, a memorable experience that adds a personal touch to their involvement.\n\nTeams of 7-10 students from each school are trained by their PE teachers or volleyball coaches. They learn the nuances of the 3-4 ball rotation system, a strategy designed to maintain the game’s pace. This practical experience is complemented by practice matches, sometimes with their feeder high schools, preparing them for the high-energy environment of the state tournament.\n\nThe St. Vrain Valley students’ involvement in the CHSAA state volleyball tournament offers them a multifaceted experience. It’s a chance to be part of a team, to learn about responsibility and quick decision-making, and to soak in the excitement of high-stakes high school sports. The added perk of interacting with the players and collecting autographs only enriches this experience, bridging the gap between the students and the athletes.\n\nAs the program completes its 25th year, it embodies more than a tradition of assistance in a sports event. It represents a legacy of community involvement, educational opportunities, and a celebration of high school sports’ spirit. The St. Vrain Valley School District’s unique role in the CHSAA state volleyball tournament highlights the importance of youth engagement in sports and the lasting impact of positive role models and memorable experiences.\n\nFuture Ready Festival: Experience the St. Vrain Advantage\n\nSt. Vrain Valley Schools invites the community to attend the Future Ready Festival.

Together they conducted hands-on experiments to study the presence and behavior of microorganisms on various surfaces.\n\nA microbial lab is a specialized laboratory where students explore and cultivate tiny living organisms known as microbes, especially bacteria. The primary objective of the lab is to teach students the scientific method and provide them with a solid foundation in microbiology techniques.\n\nJayme Sneider, Biosciences Teacher at the Innovation Center, is dedicated to making science accessible to all, which is why she developed a program to bring her Intro to Biotechnology students and 5th graders together for a microbial inquiry lab. “The main focus of this collaboration is to provide elementary students with an opportunity to engage in hands-on scientific exploration, guided by our high school students,” said Sneider. “It’s all about fostering a love for science at a young age.”\n\nUnder the guidance of the high school students, the fifth graders began the experiment by swabbing various high-touch surfaces like doorknobs and countertops. Students placed their samples in incubators, creating the ideal conditions for bacterial growth. They monitored the cultures over several days to draw conclusions from their experiments. Their goal was to identify the types of microbes inhabiting these surfaces and investigate how factors like hand sanitizer and gloves affect microbial growth. They also learned essential biotech skills, including the delicate technique of pouring agar plates, which serve as food for bacteria.\n\nOne of the most important elements of the microbial lab was the opportunity for high school students to take on roles as mentors and educators for their younger peers. They transitioned from being the learners to becoming instructors, utilizing the equipment they had prepared to guide elementary students through the scientific process. “I like the technicality and experimental aspect of the lab and helping the 5th graders learn new skills,” shared Grace Fernandez, senior at Skyline High School.\n\n“The feedback from my high school students was really funny because they said that the elementary school students kept asking them, like, how’d you get that job? How is it working as a scientist? It made my high school students feel really special and important, and it gave them a sense of looking ahead towards their career pathway,” shared Sneider.\n\nThe highlight of the project was when the high school students became the teachers, passing on their knowledge to the fifth graders. This shift allowed the high school students to see the purpose of their work and feel a sense of importance in educating others, quickly adapting to their role as mentors and relishing the opportunity to answer a wide range of questions, not just limited to science. This project also checked several boxes in their journey toward biotech credentials. They learned essential lab techniques, honed their skills, and taught the younger students, further deepening their understanding of the subject matter.\n\n“My high school students came out more energized, seeing the purpose of the work and the importance of educating others,” shared Sneider. “They felt like their skills were better; they could explain and understand concepts better because they had to explain them to elementary school students who are so eager about everything. As a result, the fifth graders were left with a new and exciting interest in science.”\n\nFuture Ready Festival: Experience the St. Vrain Advantage\n\nSt. Vrain Valley Schools invites the community to attend the Future Ready Festival.

The event took place at the Innovation Center of St. Vrain Valley Schools, where graduates from the past four cohorts of FalconTECH at Skyline High and the inaugural cohort of EagleTECH at Frederick High gathered to mark their achievement of earning associate’s degrees.\n\nThe ceremony was a culmination of years of hard work and dedication by these students.

The first panel was composed of mentors, both from within and outside of St. Vrain, and graduates of St. Vrain P-TECH programs. The second panel of the evening was with current college students from CU Boulder and Colorado State University, all of which graduated from St. Vrain’s P-TECH programs.\n\nThe final panel of the evening was with parents of graduates from the FalconTECH Program, who shared their views on how P-TECH had positively impacted their children’s lives and opened doors to new opportunities.\n\nThe highlight of the event was the launch of the Colorado P-TECH Alumni Network website. Led by P-TECH graduates, this platform will serve as a resource hub and networking space for P-TECH alumni as they navigate their careers.\n\n“It’s with immense pride that I’ve witnessed the journey of our P-TECH graduates, not just in academic accomplishments, but in the profound growth of their leadership abilities,” said St. Vrain’s P-TECH coordinator Louise March. “Our P-TECH graduates are poised to shape industries, uplift communities, and inspire future generations – this celebration is a reminder that P-TECH is not just an educational program; it’s a pathway to a successful future.”\n\nFuture Ready Festival: Experience the St. Vrain Advantage\n\nSt. Vrain Valley Schools invites the community to attend the Future Ready Festival.

From June 22 to 24, this prestigious event brought together students from across the globe to demonstrate their remarkable talents and achievements in the field of underwater robotics. Beyond the showcases of competition and technical prowess, the championships served as a transformative platform, fostering cross-cultural understanding, collaboration, and the formation of lifelong friendships.\n\nThe journey to host the World Championships began over a year ago when the Innovation Center recognized the potential of the district’s brand new Aquatic Center. Equally important was the incredible work being done by students within the district, particularly in the areas of conservation, robotics, and real-life experiences. This combination set the stage for a truly extraordinary event.\n\nNate Wilcox, a passionate teacher and advocate for education and robotics, spoke highly of the MATE ROV Competition, which focuses on real-world applications. “Students competing in the event had to think like entrepreneurs and engineers, utilizing their skills in computer science, electromechanical engineering, fabrication, design, and communication to build the best remotely operated vehicles (ROVs),” said Wilcox. “The competition’s multidisciplinary approach encouraged students to demonstrate their abilities not only in technical aspects but also in marketing, safety documentation, corporate responsibility, and engineering presentations.”\n\nThe impact of the MATE World Championships reached far beyond the competition itself. Oceans, responsible for at least 50% of the world’s oxygen and with a significant influence on the global climate, affect every individual, regardless of their geographical location. Even land-locked regions like Colorado have valuable use cases that impact lakes, reservoirs, rivers, and ponds. The competition highlighted the importance of preserving and understanding these bodies of water, raising awareness among participants about the significance of environmental stewardship.\n\nThe event also provided an invaluable opportunity for students to connect on a global scale. Vanicia Thomas, a sophomore at Erie High School, described her life-changing experience as a member of the Innovation Center Aquatic Robotics team, “Starting from ground one, the team built their robot together, regardless of prior experience.” During the World Championships, Thomas had the chance to meet students from Egypt, who were experiencing their first trip outside their country. Despite the competitive nature of the event, Thomas extended her hand in friendship, “It was just so amazing because we’re all the same grade and we all have similar hobbies. The only thing is that they live millions of miles away from us. The team from Egypt is coming over to dinner and we’re going to go on a hike in Boulder.” The bond formed between students from different parts of the world, who shared similar interests, showcased the power of robotics in breaking down barriers and fostering understanding.\n\nSebastian Delgado Martinez, another student from Erie High School and on the Innovation Center team, echoed Thomas’ sentiments, “The other teams were all really nice and even though they were the competition, they helped us when we suffered troubles during the matches.” This sense of collaboration and sportsmanship demonstrated the true essence of the robotics community. He emphasized the remarkable connections forged during the event. Meeting people from different countries who shared the same interests was a truly enlightening experience.\n\nThe success of the MATE World Championships extended beyond the competition floor. It was a testament to the outstanding collaboration within the St. Vrain Valley School District. The district’s commitment to supporting the event, the Innovation Center, Silver Creek High School (where the Aquatics Center is located), the many departments supporting the event, and the participating students was evident. Their willingness to work together across departments showcased a culture of collaboration, where individuals provided critical value to the community.\n\nOver 60 teams from 11 countries and 18 U.S. states converged at the Aquatic Center of St. Vrain Valley Schools, creating a sense of pride and honor within the local community as this district served as host to the international participants.The event allowed the work done at the Innovation Center and in the district to shine on a global stage, demonstrating the power of public education. The exposure to universities, after-school programs, and other high schools reinforced the district’s commitment to excellence in education.\n\nThe MATE World Championships not only celebrated the achievements of the brightest young minds in underwater robotics but also acted as a catalyst for building bridges across borders and empowering students to become compassionate, collaborative, and globally aware citizens of the future.\n\nTo find out more about MATE, please visit https://materovcompetition.org/\n\nTo see the full album of pictures, please visit stvra.in/matephotos2023\n\nFuture Ready Festival: Experience the St. Vrain Advantage\n\nSt. Vrain Valley Schools invites the community to attend the Future Ready Festival.

The panel was composed of medical professionals from various departments at the hospital. Panelists shared personal experiences and insights about their respective careers, highlighting the opportunities and challenges that come with working in the medical field.\n\nFollowing the health panel, students toured the hospital, where they gained an understanding of the different departments and got a glimpse of the cutting-edge medical technologies readily accessible to the community.\n\nNiwot High School juniors Micky Nguyen and Sarada Gundavarapu started the FMPC with the goal of providing a unique platform for students to learn about the various medical fields and gain a better understanding of what a career in healthcare entails. “We wanted people to see that there’s more to healthcare than being a doctor or a nurse,” said Nguyen.\n\nThe club gives members a way to explore their professional interests, visit medical facilities, gain hands-on experience, and make connections with professionals in the healthcare industry. “The Future Medical Professionals Club gives you a very big head start if you’re wanting to pursue a career in the medical field,” said Mead High School sophomore, Basia Marrufo. “It helps grow your interest and gets you acquainted with the various areas in the industry.”\n\nThe FMPC is sponsored by UCHealth and is open to all St. Vrain Valley high school students who are interested in pursuing a career in the medical field. Lonnie Cramer, President of Longs Peak Hospital and Broomfield Hospital, is proud of the partnership between UCHealth and St. Vrain Valley Schools. “It means a lot to UCHealth, and it means a lot to our community,” said Cramer. “We’re going to grow the health care leaders of tomorrow, and we’re going to help students identify early on what makes sense for them.”\n\nAt the health panel, students learned there are many paths they can take to obtain a position in healthcare, and many don’t require a four-year college degree or a degree in science. According to pediatrician Dr. Mark Shane, “You should really get a college degree in what excites you. They [medical schools] love people who are not science majors. They want people who have diverse backgrounds.”\n\nPanelists shared about their unique journeys that led them to careers in the medical field. Shannon Griffith, Manager of Radiology Services, initially studied art and taught elementary school before finding her passion in radiology. Laura Welsh, Manager of the Emergency Department, went to school to be a teacher, but a life-changing experience led her to switch careers. “Life can lead you down different paths, and once you find what you love, you’ll know it,” said Welsh.\n\nWorking in healthcare offers a unique advantage in terms of job mobility because healthcare professionals are in high demand and can work anywhere in the world. The need for healthcare services is also constant, which means individuals typically have stability and security in their careers.\n\nEvery person who walks through the doors of a hospital or medical facility is going through something, and medical professionals have the ability to directly influence their lives. “Working in healthcare is really just about helping people,” said Dr. Shane. Communication and listening skills are essential in the medical field. They are critical in creating a positive patient experience, building trust with patients, and their families, and ensuring the correct information and treatment plans are understood. Additionally, strong communication and listening skills can improve patient satisfaction, reduce medical errors, and contribute to better health outcomes.\n\nTo learn more about the Future Medical Professionals Club, visit stvra.in/fmp.\n\nFuture Ready Festival: Experience the St. Vrain Advantage\n\nSt. Vrain Valley Schools invites the community to attend the Future Ready Festival.

However, SuperSTEM Camp enrollees are anything but typical. These students spend their summer working with robots, building code, programming circuit boards, visiting the University of Colorado Boulder, and learning about how artificial intelligence functions.\n\nThe Innovation Center of St. Vrain Valley Schools hosts SuperSTEM Camps throughout the summer, engaging students in hands-on experiences with STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) topics. This year’s camps were attended by 432 elementary and middle school students, as well as 99 high schoolers. The June camps have seen participants conduct bioscience experiments, explore artificial intelligence, design their own airplanes, learn about sustainable business practices, and practice drone videography. These activities were just the start of summer learning experiences for SuperSTEM Camp enrollees.\n\nPartnering with both the University of Colorado Boulder and Northrop Grumman, some students in the July SuperSTEM Camp have also been introduced to the fundamentals of Cybersecurity or challenged to take their Cybersecurity prowess to the next level in an advanced group. Others have explored the foundations of machine learning and the different applications of machine learning models, and some students have even worked with robots to research how they can be used to better our planet. These experiences encourage students to continue pushing the limits of their educational growth, even during the summer.\n\n“The Innovation Center just finished its eighth year as a program. We have been doing SuperSTEM since the end of our first year during the summer of 2015, which we held at our previous site at the Career Elevation and Technology Center (CETC),” says Axel Reitzig, Innovation Center Executive Director. “Summer and extracurricular engagement is a huge part of our district’s success and we’re pleased to be able to contribute to this through our programs.”\n\nDuring the last camp of the summer, the AMD PYNQ Board Bootcamp, students used AMD-Xilinx embedded platforms and the Python programming language to explore smart and sustainable farming practices. Students have been collecting, organizing, and displaying data relevant to plant health and crop yield, hearing from industry experts on how technology is informing and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of seeding, monitoring of plant health, and harvesting, and using electrical components in conjunction with basic Python to create self-driven projects within small teams. These projects are highly relevant to the modern world and keep students’ problem-solving and critical thinking skills sharp.\n\n“This is an amazing camp for people who like technology because it goes further than just programming,” says eighth grade student, Daniel Goodman, who was participating in his second year at the PYNQ camp. “We get hands-on experience with circuit boards, and use our programming experience to create unique projects.”\n\nThe Innovation Center is already looking ahead to next summer where they will continue to expand these opportunities to further maximize hands-on learning experiences and challenge students to think critically and creatively.\n\n“We also offer various extensions during the year through our support of extracurricular programs like our district VEX Robotics or our Cyberpatriots programs,” says Reitzig.” Additionally, we offer special opportunities during the year like our Code Zone Challenge for middle school students.”\n\nSt. Vrain Valley Schools seeks to engage students in problem-solving while staying on the forefront of utilizing technology in education, and SuperSTEM camps are just one of the many opportunities students are afforded.\n\nTo learn more about SuperSTEM camps and the Innovation Center’s other program offerings, please visit: https://innovation.svvsd.org.\n\nFuture Ready Festival: Experience the St. Vrain Advantage\n\nSt. Vrain Valley Schools invites the community to attend the Future Ready Festival.
